Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## Estimates

Regarding the **estimates** that you did for practical tasks...

### How was your estimate accuracy usually?

Far from enough

### How did your estimate accuracy improve or change during the course of the subject?

Try to deduce pseudocode

### What did you learn from doing these estimates?

Programming logic and required functionality

## Code Reviews

### What have you learned from being reviewed by other people?

Different ideas, sometimes clearer than mine

### What have you learned from doing code reviews of other people?

Checking others' is also a test of how well I have learned.

Provide proper Markdown links (not bare URLs) to two (2) PRs that show you doing good code reviews for any of the past
pracs.  
For each one, write a short explanation of what was good about your review.

### Good Code Review 1

https://github.com/YoungJCU/CP1404Prac/pull/4#issuecomment-3043591709

### Explanation

Reviewing other people's code also makes me reflect on my own code

### Good Code Review 2

https://github.com/KaungKhantKyaw1st/CP-1404-prac/pull/10

### Explanation

Other peopleâ€™s code may be easier to understand and more functional than my own. 
Reviewing their code helps me change bad habits and clarify my logic.

## Practicals

### Regarding the **practical tasks** overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?

I will provide the correct example on GitHub after the students submit it.

### What did you do really well for practicals in this subject?

Keep thinking, review course materials at any time, and complete exercises independently
